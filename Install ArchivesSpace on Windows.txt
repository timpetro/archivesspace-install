ARCHIVESSPACE Installation in 15 steps on Windows 2019 Server as a service
(Step by Step using a virtual machine)

	Open Control panel | type java in the search (upper right) and open the Java control panel
		Click on JAVA tab, click view and record the path: example C:\Program Files\Java\jre8\bin\javaw.exe (you will need to know the path, without the filename on the end, in the next step)
		Close the Java control panel.
3.) Configure a new variable and modify the system path
	In the Windows control panel | type 'system' without the quotes in the search (upper right) and select "Edit the system environment variables"

	Reboot the computer
	Open a command prompt
		set | find "java" /I
		confirm your path statement contains a path to java's bin folder
		confirm your JAVA_HOME is also correct pointing to the jre install folder


4.) Prerequisites in Windows
	Manage the firewall (for our demo we turn it off, but you can to permit just tcp 8080, 8081, 8082, 8089, 8090, 8091 etc)

	Optional items: (instructions for each are not here but discussed in the video
		Optionally Set the IP address to a static address (highly recommended for production environments)
		Optionally Join a domain (recommended for a production environment where the company has an active directory. We recommend you wait to do this until after the setup is fully complete and tested.

5.) Install MySQL, configure, and verify the service
	Download the file from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
		File name: mysql-installer-community-8.0.24.0.msi
		Run the file and select:
		Server only | Next | Execute
		Next
		Select Use legacy | Next
		Set the password | Next
		Take defaults on Windows service | Next | Execute | Finish
		Next | Finish

6.) Create MySQL DB, verify, create user, set privileges, set "global":
	From the start menu | open MySQL 8.0 Command Line Client (you'll arrive at mysql> prompt) 
		create database archivesspace default character set utf8mb4;
		SHOW DATABASES; (verify the archivesspace db exists)
		create user 'as'@'localhost' identified by 'as123'; 
		grant all privileges on archivesspace.* to 'as'@'localhost';
		SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
		exit

7.) Copy the archivesspace folder from the zip file to c:/archivesspace
	To do this, just right click the zip file, select extract to, and select C:\
	It will take a few minutes

8.) Install mysql java connector (use the same version as your MySql)
	Download the software at https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
	The download file name is: mysql-connector-java-8.0.24.zip
	The file inside the zip file we need is called mysql-connector-java-8.0.24.jar
	Copy the mysql-connector-java-8.0.24.jar file into the folder C:\archivesspace\lib

9.) Modify the main config file with 3 changes
	Use Notepad to open c:\archivesspace\config\config.rb
	Around line 16, add a new line and paste in the next line (left justified) 
	   AppConfig[:db_url] = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/archivesspace?user=as&password=as123&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8"
	Around line 346, Find the following two lines and remove the # from the front of each line. Also change the first line from false to true
		AppConfig[:use_jetty_shutdown_handler] = true
		AppConfig[:jetty_shutdown_path] = "/xkcd"
	Save the file and exit Notepad

10.) Setup the database
	open command prompt as administrator (important to run as administrator)
	cd c:\archivesspace\scripts
	setup-database.bat
		Watch the setup script for errors
		It should finish with "all done" if it worked correctly
	close command prompt

11.) Run the program first time (takes several minutes to fully startup)
	open command prompt, not as administrator this time (we'll refer to this as command prompt 1)
	cd c:\archivesspace
	archivesspace.bat
	wait 5 minutes
	open a second terminal (command prompt 2)
	netstat -an -p tcp | find "80" and wait till you see all the ports, specifically 8080 in a listening state
	try to access http://ipaddress_of_your_server:8080, login as admin, admin and then logout
		If you do not know the IP address of your server type ipconfig and look for your IP address
		Login as username admin password admin
		Create a test repository inside the program.
		logout 
	back in command prompt 1... 
	ctrl c and y to terminate batch job to close it

12.) Install executables required to create services
	Download the software from https://downloads.apache.org/commons/daemon/binaries/windows/
	Filename: commons-daemon-1.2.4-bin-windows.zip 
	open zip and copy prunmgr.exe and prunsrv.exe to c:\archivespace\
	

13.) Set up to run as a service and modify the service recovery
	open command prompt as administrator (important to run as administrator)
	cd c:\archivesspace\launcher
	service.bat
		It will first show informational text about requirements	
		Press your spacebar to finish
		Closet the command prompt	
		Check in the c:\archivesspace folder for two new executables named:
			ArchivesSpaceService.exe - which is the actual service that will run all the time to make the application available
			ArchiveSspaceServicew.exe - (note: ends in a w) which is used to manage or monitor the service, but is not required to always be running. We use this to configure the service later.
	Click Windows icon bottom left, start typing services and click the "services" desktop app
	Locate the ArchivesSpaceService and double-click it
	Click on the recovery tab and set first, second and third failure to 'restart the service"
	Leave the "restart service after" to 1 minute

14.) Modify the service and test start it using the new service executable
	open command prompt as administrator
	cd c:\archivesspace\
	ArchivesSpaceServicew.exe //ES//
		On the Java tab set the Java Virtual Machine to the java install directory/bin/server/jvm.dll ... example
			C:\Program Files\Java\jre8\bin\server\jvm.dll
		On the startup folder, set the working path to your archivesspace folder ... example
			C:\archivesspace
		Click APPLY
		On the general tab click START
		Click start
			The services should start
	open a second terminal (command prompt 2)
	type ipconfig and look for your IP address
	netstat -an -p tcp | find "80" and wait till you see all the ports, specifically 8080 in a listening state
	try to access http://ipaddress_of_your_server:8080, login as admin, admin and then logout

15.) Finally Test the fully built Server by rebooting
	reboot the server
	Wait 3 or 4 minutes and don't login to the Windows server at all
	try to access http://ipaddress_of_your_server:8080, login as admin, admin and then logout
