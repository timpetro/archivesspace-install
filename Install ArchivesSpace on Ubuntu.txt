ARCHIVESSPACE Installation in 15 steps on Ubuntu Linux as a service
(Step by Step using a virtual machine)

1.) Install Ubuntu LTE Desktop 20.04.1 Minimal Install
	Notes: for VCENTER/ESXi Installations only:
			When installing on ESXi/Vcenter you will have to choose to use a network adapter of these types:
			VMXNET3 
			E1000
			VMXNET3 requires drivers to work, driver that come from the install of VMWare tools. Prior to that you will have no network.
			E1000 doesn't require any software but must be manually selected when creating the vm prior to powering it on the first time.
			VMXNET3 is the higher performing network adapter but most will not notice the difference with this type of application
			Ironically VMWare recommends the install of "open-vm-tools" and not their own which do not provide the driver for VMXNET3
				If your using VCenter/ESXi, to install the open VM tools, after the OS is installed, and the network card is working:
				open terminal
				sudo apt install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop

2.) Install Java 1.8 and verify:
	open terminal
	sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
	java -version

3.) (OPTIONAL) For diagnosing hosted ports later.
	open terminal
	sudo apt install net-tools

4.) Install MySQL, configure, and verify the service
	open terminal
	sudo apt install mysql-server
	sudo su
	sudo mysql_secure_installation
		No validate
		Set root password
		Remove anonymous users - Y
		Disable remote root login - Y
		Remove test Db - Y
		Reload privilege tables - Y
	sudo service mysql status
	close the terminal window

5.) Create MySQL DB, verify, create user, set privledges, set "global":
	open terminal
	sudo mysql (you'll arrive at mysql> prompt) 
		create database archivesspace default character set utf8mb4;
		SHOW DATABASES; (verify the archivesspace db exists)
		create user 'as'@'localhost' identified by 'as123'; 
		grant all privileges on archivesspace.* to 'as'@'localhost';
		SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
		exit
	sudo service mysql status

6.) Copy the archivesspace folder from the zip file to /home/asuser/archivesspace

7.) Install mysql java connector (use the same version as your MySql)
	open terminal
	sudo apt install curl
	cd ~/archivesspace/lib
	sudo curl -Oq https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.23/mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar 
	ls mysql* 

8.) Modify the main config file with 3 changes
	open terminal
	cd ~/archivesspace/config
	gedit ./config.rb
	Around line 16, add a new line and paste in the next line (left justified) 
	   AppConfig[:db_url] = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/archivesspace?user=as&password=as123&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8"
	Around line 346, Find the following two lines and remove the # from the front of each line. Also change the first line from false to true
		AppConfig[:use_jetty_shutdown_handler] = true
		AppConfig[:jetty_shutdown_path] = "/xkcd"
	Save the file

9.) Setup the database
	open terminal
	cd ~/archivesspace/scripts
	./setup-database.sh

10.) Run the program first time (takes several minutes to fully startup)
	open terminal 
	cd ~/archivesspace
	./archivesspace.sh
	wait 5 minutes
	open a second terminal
	type ifconfig and look for your IP address "inet" .. not the one under 
	try to access http://ipaddress of your_server:8080
	ctrl c and close it

11.) Test using the provided script to start and stop it...
	open terminal 
	cd /archivesspace
	./archivesspace.sh start
	./archivesspace.sh stop
	./archivesspace.sh status

12.) Set up to run as a service/daemon by creating a service file
	open terminal
	sudo gedit /lib/systemd/system/archivesspace.service
	add the contents below (must be left justified) and save the file, exit gedit.

            # START OF FILE   
            # ArchivesSpace systemd service file.
   
            [Unit]
            Description=ArchivesSpace Application
            After=syslog.target network.target

            [Install]
            WantedBy=multi-user.target

            [Service]
            Type=forking
            ExecStart=/home/asuser/archivesspace/archivesspace.sh start
            ExecStop=/home/asuser/archivesspace/archivesspace.sh stop
            # PIDFile=/home/asuser/archivesspace/archivesspace.pid
            User=asuser
            Group=asuser
            Restart=on-failure
            RestartSec=20s
            # END OF FILE  
   
13.) Create symbolic link 
	open terminal
	cd /etc/systemd/system
	sudo ln -s /lib/systemd/system/archivesspace.service
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload

14.) Test the service file works to start and stop the service
	open terminal
	sudo systemctl start archivesspace.service
	sudo systemctl status archivesspace.service
	netstat -ant (look for tcp/8080 etc)
	https://ipaddress:8080 (confirm its working)
	sudo systemctl stop  archivesspace.service
	Note: Troubleshooting SystemD logs that are helpful run from terminal
		journalctl  -xe
		sudo cat /var/log/dmesg

15.) Enable the new service to run on boot
	open terminal
	sudo systemctl enable archivesspace.service
	reboot
	wait a few minutes, test it without logging into Ubuntu from another computer.
	https://ipaddress:8080 (from another computer on your network and confirm its working)
